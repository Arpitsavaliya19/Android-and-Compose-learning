🧪 Independent Practice & Concept Reinforcement
Beyond the official course projects, I built additional experimental applications to deepen my understanding of core Android concepts.

These projects were used to:
Re-implement features without step-by-step guidance
Practice architectural refactoring
Experiment with adaptive layouts
Strengthen networking and state handling patterns
Improve code organization and reusability
This self-driven practice helped transition from guided learning to independent implementation.
